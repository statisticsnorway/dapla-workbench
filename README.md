[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/statisticsnorway/Dapla/_apis/build/status/statisticsnorway.dapla-workbench?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/statisticsnorway/Dapla/_build/latest?definitionId=20&branchName=master)

This project aggregates Dapla frontend resources into a common web page to access and read about them easily. 
Eventually it aims to import every application and expose them all to the user through a "workbench" type application.
